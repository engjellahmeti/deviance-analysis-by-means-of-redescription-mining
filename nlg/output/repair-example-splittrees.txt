--> The negative event log has the following rules:
            1. If the register resource differs from Tester that implicates that the user resource is not Tester. (r7)
            2. If the process is executed by Tester and the register resource is not Solver that implicates that the user complexity of repair is equal to Complex and the user resource is not System and the process is not executed by Tester or the user resource is Tester. (r1)
            3. If the process is executed by Tester that implicates that the user resource is Tester. (r3)

--> While the positive event log has the following rules:
            1. If the process is executed by System that implicates that the user complexity of repair is unequal to Complex. (r17)
            2. If the register resource is Solver that implicates that the user complexity of repair is equal to Complex. (r21)
            3. If the process is not executed by System that implicates that the process is executed by Solver. (r37)

Comparisons between the set of negative and positive redescription rules that relate on the attribute names, but have different nature:
The first mined negative rule  is 'If the register resource differs from Tester that implicates that the process is not executed by Tester. (r7)' and its subrules comparisons to the positive subrules are below:
          - The resource for the event 'Register' differs from Tester in the negative rule, while in the positive rule r37, it differs from System.
          - The resource for the event 'Inform User' is not executed by Tester in the negative rule, while in the positive rule r37, it is executed by Solver.

The second mined negative rule  is 'If the process is executed by Tester that implicates that the process is executed by Tester. (r3)' and its subrules comparisons to the positive subrules are below:
          - The resource for the event 'Register' is executed by Tester in the negative rule, while in the positive rule r37, it is not executed by System.
          - The resource for the event 'Inform User' is executed by Tester in the negative rule, while in the positive rule r37, it is Solver.

Concrete examples of traces that failed:
The process execution with 'Case No. 987' is deviant because the process is not executed by Solver (r21), the process is not executed by System (r17) and the process is not executed by Solver (r37).
The process execution with 'Case No. 101' is deviant because the process is not executed by System (r17) and the process is not executed by Solver (r37).
The process execution with 'Case No. 475' is deviant because the process is not executed by Solver (r37), the user complexity of repair is not Complex (r21) and the process is not executed by System (r17).
The process execution with 'Case No. 467' is deviant because the process is not executed by Solver (r21), the process is not executed by Solver (r37) and the process is not executed by System (r17).
The process execution with 'Case No. 987' is deviant because the process is not executed by System (r17), the process is not executed by Solver (r21) and the process is not executed by Solver (r37).
