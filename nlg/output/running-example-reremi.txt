--> The negative event log has the following rules:

Comparisons between the set of negative and positive redescription rules that relate on the attribute names, but have different nature:
The first mined negative rule  is 'If the order payment type is PayPal that implicates that the order delivery is Slow. (r23)' and its subrules comparisons to the positive subrules are below:
          - The payment type for the event 'Close Order' is PayPal in the negative rule, while in the positive rule r12, it is Transfer.
          - The delivery for the event 'Deliver Order' is Slow in the negative rule, while in the positive rule r12, it is Slow.
          - The payment type for the event 'Close Order' is PayPal in the negative rule, while in the positive rule r13, it is equal to PayPal.
          - The delivery for the event 'Deliver Order' is Slow in the negative rule, while in the positive rule r13, it is Fast.
