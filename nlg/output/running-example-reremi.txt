--> The negative event log has the following rules:
            1. If the product amount alternates between 7344 and 9642 that implicates that the order delivery is Slow. (r2)
            2. If the product price alternates between 18022 and 19671 or the product amount stretches from 3941 to 6237 that implicates that the order discount alternates between 13 and 15. (r10)
            3. If the order payment type is equal to PayPal that implicates that the order delivery is Slow. (r23)

--> While the positive event log has the following rules:
            1. If the product price is bigger than 3697 that implicates that the order delivery is equal to Fast. (r2)
            2. If the product amount doesn't go lower than 4709 that implicates that the process is executed by Company. (r5)
            3. If the product amount is lower than 4704 that implicates that the order resource is Customer. (r7)
            4. If the order delivery is Fast that implicates that the order discount stretches from 17 to 47. (r9)
            5. If the order discount ranges from 17 to 47 that implicates that the order delivery is equal to Fast. (r11)
            6. If the order payment type is equal to Transfer that implicates that the order delivery is equal to Slow. (r12)
            7. If the order payment type is equal to PayPal that implicates that the order delivery is equal to Fast. (r13)

Comparisons between the set of negative and positive redescription rules that relate on the attribute names, but have different nature:
The first mined negative rule  is 'If the order payment type is equal to PayPal that implicates that the order delivery is equal to Slow. (r23)' and its subrules comparisons to the positive subrules are below:
          - The payment type for the event 'Close Order' is equal to PayPal in the negative rule, while in the positive rule r12, it is Transfer.
          - The delivery for the event 'Deliver Order' is equal to Slow in the negative rule, while in the positive rule r13, it is Fast.
