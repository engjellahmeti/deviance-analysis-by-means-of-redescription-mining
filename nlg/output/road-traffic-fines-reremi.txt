--> The negative event log has the following rules:
            1. If the notification type is equal to C that implicates that the penalty amount is smaller than 4950. (r0)
            2. If the notification type is equal to P that implicates that the penalty amount is bigger than 5000. (r2)

--> While the positive event log has the following rules:
            1. If the notification type is equal to C that implicates that the penalty amount is bigger than 5000. (r2)
            2. If the notification type is equal to P that implicates that the penalty amount is smaller than 4909. (r3)
            3. If the penalty amount doesn't go lower than 5000 that implicates that the collection resource is Admin. (r6)
            4. If the penalty amount is lower than 4951 that implicates that the collection resource is Police. (r7)

Comparisons between the set of negative and positive redescription rules that relate on the attribute names, but have different nature:
The first mined negative rule  is 'If the notification type is C that implicates that the penalty amount is smaller than 4950. (r0)' and its subrules comparisons to the positive subrules are below:
          - The notification type for the event 'Insert Fine Notification' is C in the negative rule, while in the positive rule r2, it is C.
          - The amount for the event 'Add Penalty' is smaller than 4950 in the negative rule, while in the positive rule r2, it is bigger than 5000.
          - The notification type for the event 'Insert Fine Notification' is C in the negative rule, while in the positive rule r3, it is P.
          - The amount for the event 'Add Penalty' is smaller than 4950 in the negative rule, while in the positive rule r3, it is lower than 4909.

The second mined negative rule  is 'If the notification type is equal to P that implicates that the penalty amount doesn't go lower than 5000. (r2)' and its subrules comparisons to the positive subrules are below:
          - The notification type for the event 'Insert Fine Notification' is equal to P in the negative rule, while in the positive rule r2, it is C.
          - The amount for the event 'Add Penalty' doesn't go lower than 5000 in the negative rule, while in the positive rule r2, it is bigger than 5000.
          - The notification type for the event 'Insert Fine Notification' is equal to P in the negative rule, while in the positive rule r3, it is P.
          - The amount for the event 'Add Penalty' doesn't go lower than 5000 in the negative rule, while in the positive rule r3, it is lesser than 4909.

Concrete examples of traces that failed:
The process execution with 'Case No. 900' is deviant because the process is not executed by Admin (r6), the penalty amount is above 4909 (r3) and the penalty amount is higher than 4951 (r7).
The process execution with 'Case No. 39' is deviant because the penalty amount is smaller than 5000 (r6), the notification type is unequal to P (r3) and the penalty amount is smaller than 5000 (r2).
The process execution with 'Case No. 863' is deviant because the notification type differs from C (r2), the penalty amount is not below 4909 (r3) and the process is not executed by Admin (r6).
The process execution with 'Case No. 900' is deviant because the penalty amount is higher than 4951 (r7), the notification type is unequal to C (r2) and the penalty amount is above 4909 (r3).
The process execution with 'Case No. 815' is deviant because the penalty amount is higher than 4909 (r3), the process is not executed by Police (r7) and the process is not executed by Admin (r6).
